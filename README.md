# 👋 Hi, I'm Matthew Baker

I’m an AI/ML Product Owner with a proven track record building scalable machine learning systems in regulated environments — currently at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). My work focuses on transforming real-world workflows into ML pipelines and AI-powered services.

### 🧠 What I Do
- 🚀 Lead end-to-end ML product development — from prototype to production
- 🔎 Build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for patent workflows
- 📊 Translate stakeholder needs into clean data pipelines running 24/7 in Production
- ☁️ Manage deployment of containerized inference services on AWS, Azure, and on-prem solutions

### 📌 Some Featured Projects (outside of my work duties)

- [**RAG-RAG Starter Kit**](https://github.com/mharrisonbaker/rag-rag-starter)  
  A reality-rooted RAG framework for federal compliance. No Digital DMT 🌀 included — this architecture keeps AI systems grounded in verifiable sources and compliant with federal requirements.

- [**CODE @USPTO Newsletter Project**](https://github.com/USPTOCode/uspto-newsletter)  
  Born out of laziness, a Python + React system to streamline newsletter creation and distribution for the Club for Open Data Enthusiasts (C.O.D.E.); not an official USPTO project :)

- [**Chat-MPEP**](https://github.com/USPTOCode/MPEP-Chatbot)  
 She’s an older manual, sir…but she's got it where it counts. Indexed, embedded, and chat-ready. Chat-MPEP transforms the USPTO’s Manual of Patent Examining Procedure from RDMS format (🤮) into structured JSON (🧼) and powers an interactive chatbot using LlamaIndex and Microsoft Phi, demoed on an airgapped laptop at USPTO Community Day 2024.

- [**CPC Definition Expansion Tool**](https://github.com/USPTOCode/expandedCPCdefinitions)  
  Sample code from a larger project I am working on. Human-readable definitions for 250,000 CPC symbols using LLMs and a deep respect for taxonomy. Finally a way through the classification rabbit hole without losing your head 👑
